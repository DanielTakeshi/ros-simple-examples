# Cameras

## Fetch

- Start a gazebo simulator so that you have a ROS master, for example:
  
  `roslaunch fetch_gazebo playground.launch`

- Then run `python camera.py`, or with a different set of arguments. It may be
  helpful to adjust the gazebo simulator so that the robot is actually seeing
  something interesting (then you can test the cameras).
