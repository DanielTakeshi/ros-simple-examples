# ros-simple-examples

Some ROS code examples which hopefully are robot-agnostic. I'll test in
simulation and hopefully it's just a toggle to figure out which robot to use,
plus a list of the appropriate robot's ROS topic names.

Examples:

- `camera`: Processes the robot's camera images. Mostly understood.
- `states`: WIP, not working.

There are also topics for the robots listed in `topics`. However, these might be
dependent on what kind of launch file we used for the simulator?

TODOs:

- Get used to the different message types.
